# Hayben The Potato

Hayben The Potato is a game created for the (V03) Software Engineering Team.

## Topic

Develop a fantasy game in The Lost City of Atlantis. Player(s) dive into the underwater ruins of Atlantis
to uncover its secrets and complete a quest for lost artifacts. They must solve ancient puzzles, avoid
underwater hazards, and interact with the remnants of Atlantean technology. Key features should
include underwater exploration with environmental challenges, ancient technology and puzzle-solving,
interaction with mythical sea creatures, and remnants of an advanced civilization. “The Lost City of
